# DESTRIPTION : Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning on Breast Cancer

In this project, I aimed to develop a predictive model for diagnosing breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The primary goal was to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on clinical features. I began by collecting and exploring the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which contains features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness of cell nuclei derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass.

I performed thorough data preprocessing, handling missing values and checking for any inconsistencies. I normalized the features to ensure that all variables contributed equally to the model. For exploratory data analysis, I used visualization techniques like histograms, correlation heatmaps, and boxplots to understand feature distributions and relationships.

Next, I split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively. I experimented with various supervised machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). I tuned hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

Among the models, Random Forest and SVM gave the highest accuracy, precision, and recall. I evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve. The final model achieved an accuracy of over 97% on the test set, demonstrating strong predictive capability.

I also used feature importance analysis to identify which features most influenced the predictions. This not only improved interpretability but also allowed me to reduce the modelâ€™s complexity by removing less significant features without compromising accuracy.

Throughout the project, I used Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I documented my workflow clearly to ensure reproducibility.

In conclusion, this project allowed me to apply machine learning concepts in a real-world healthcare scenario, reinforcing my skills in data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and interpretation. It highlighted the potential of machine learning to aid early detection of breast cancer, which can ultimately improve patient outcomes.
